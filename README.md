##Programming Group, Bios 2025-2026

This Organization will be your guide as you create your presence as a programmer in Github. Each one of you will have to design, create, maintain and update your webpages. 

This is also where you will create your projects for evaluators as a freelancer, college student, and any other groups that need to check your programming skills.
